  "extra_movies": [

    {"movie_title": "another different title exactly as in the list", "genres": ["Genre1"]}

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 — clear match:
Candidates: 1. Shrek (7.9) | Comedy, Animation  2. Interstellar (8.6) | Sci-Fi, Drama  3. The Matrix (8.7) | Action, Sci-Fi
Group vibes: wants comedy and something chill
Output: {"thought": "Group wants comedy and chill. Shrek is the only comedy on the list and fits perfectly.", "movie_title": "Shrek", "genres": ["Comedy", "Animation"], "reasoning": "Shrek is a lighthearted comedy-animation that directly matches the group's request for something fun and chill. It requires no prior knowledge and works well for a relaxed group setting.", "extra_movies": [{"movie_title": "Interstellar", "genres": ["Sci-Fi", "Drama"]}, {"movie_title": "The Matrix", "genres": ["Action", "Sci-Fi"]}]}

Example 2 — ambiguous vibes, prefer higher rating:
Candidates: 1. The Notebook (7.0) | Romance, Drama  2. La La Land (8.0) | Romance, Musical  3. Titanic (7.9) | Romance, Drama
Group vibes: romantic evening, something emotional
Output: {"thought": "All three are romantic and emotional. Vibes are ambiguous so I prefer the highest rated — La La Land at 8.0.", "movie_title": "La La Land", "genres": ["Romance", "Musical"], "reasoning": "La La Land is a romantic and emotionally resonant film that fits the group's mood well. Since multiple candidates matched equally, it was selected for its higher rating among the options.", "extra_movies": [{"movie_title": "Titanic", "genres": ["Romance", "Drama"]}, {"movie_title": "The Notebook", "genres": ["Romance", "Drama"]}]}

Example 3 — no good fit, pick closest and explain gap:
Candidates: 1. Saving Private Ryan (8.6) | War, Drama  2. 1917 (8.3) | War, Drama  3. Dunkirk (7.9) | War, Drama
Group vibes: wants something fun and lighthearted for a party
Output: {"thought": "No candidate matches a fun party vibe — all are serious war dramas. Dunkirk is the shortest and most visually intense, making it the least heavy sit for a group.", "movie_title": "Dunkirk", "genres": ["War", "Drama"], "reasoning": "None of the candidates match a fun or lighthearted party atmosphere — all are serious war dramas. Dunkirk was chosen as the closest fit due to its fast pace and shorter runtime, though the group should be aware it is an intense, dramatic film.", "extra_movies": [{"movie_title": "1917", "genres": ["War", "Drama"]}, {"movie_title": "Saving Private Ryan", "genres": ["War", "Drama"]}]}
